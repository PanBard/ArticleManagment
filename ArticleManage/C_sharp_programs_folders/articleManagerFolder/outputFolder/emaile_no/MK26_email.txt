Dear Hui Hu,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Gao, J.; Xie, J.; Liu, X.; Hu, H. Preparation and evaluation of modified cyanobacteria-derived activated carbon for H2 adsorption, RSC Adv., 7, 2017, 20412, https://doi.org/10.1039/C6RA28660G], specifically featured in  Fig. 2 (a,c), Fig. 3 (a.b.c), Fig. 2(b,d), Fig. 3(d,e,f) I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
