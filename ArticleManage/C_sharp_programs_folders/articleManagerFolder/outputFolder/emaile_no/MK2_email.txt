Dear Sirikanjana Thongmee,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Cui, X.; Jiang, Y.; He, Z.; Liu, Z.; Yang, X.; Wan, J.; Liu, Y.; Ma, F. Preparation of tank-like resin-derived porous carbon sphere for supercapacitor: The influence of KOH activator and activation temperature on structure and performance, Diamond and Related Materials, 136, 2023, 110054, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diamond.2023.110054], specifically featured in  Fig. 4.(a), Fig. 4.(b) I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
