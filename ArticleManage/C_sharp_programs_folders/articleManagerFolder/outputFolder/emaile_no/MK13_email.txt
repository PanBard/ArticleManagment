Dear Guojie Zhang,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Wu, C.; Zhang, G.; Liu, J.; Wang, Y.; Zhao, Y.; Li, G. A green strategy to prepare nitrogen-oxygen co-doped porous carbons from macadamia nut shells for post-combustion CO2 capture and supercapacitors, Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis, 171, 2023, 105952, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2023.105952], specifically featured in  Fig. 7. I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
