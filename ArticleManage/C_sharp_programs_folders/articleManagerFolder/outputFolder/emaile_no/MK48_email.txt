Dear P.J.M. Carrott,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Carrott, P.; Ribeiro Carrott, M.; Suhas,.. Comparison of the Dubininâ€“Radushkevich and Quenched Solid Density Functional Theory approaches for the characterisation of narrow microporosity in activated carbons obtained by chemical activation with KOH or NaOH of Kraft and hydrolytic lignins, Carbon, 48, 2010, 4162, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2010.07.031], specifically featured in  Fig. 1, Fig. 4, Fig. 3 I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
