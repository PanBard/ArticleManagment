Dear Naile Karakehya,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Karakehya, N. Effects of one-step and two-step KOH activation method on the properties and supercapacitor performance of highly porous activated carbons prepared from Lycopodium clavatum spores, Diamond and Related Materials, 135, 2023, 109873, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diamond.2023.109873], specifically featured in  Fig. 2. (a), Fig. 2.(b) I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
