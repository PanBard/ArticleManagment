Dear Carlos Moreno-Castilla,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Ubago-Pérez, R.; Carrasco-Marín, F.; Fairén-Jiménez, D.; Moreno-Castilla, C. Granular and monolithic activated carbons from KOH-activation of olive stones, Microporous and Mesoporous Materials, 92, 2006, 64, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micromeso.2006.01.002], specifically featured in Fig. 1. I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
