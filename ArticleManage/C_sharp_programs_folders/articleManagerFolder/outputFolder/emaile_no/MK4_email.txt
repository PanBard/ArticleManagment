Dear Gamzenur Ã–zsin,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Arami-Niya, A.; Daud, W.; Mjalli, F. Using granular activated carbon prepared from oil palm shell by ZnCl2 and physical activation for methane adsorption, Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis, 89, 2010, 197, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2010.08.006], specifically featured in  Fig. 3 I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
