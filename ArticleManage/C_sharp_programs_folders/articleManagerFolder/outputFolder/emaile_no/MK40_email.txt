Dear Jin Miyawaki,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Yi, H.; Nakabayashi, K.; Yoon, S.; Miyawaki, J. Study on the applicability of pressurized physically activated carbon as an adsorbent in adsorption heat pumps, RSC Adv., 12, 2022, 2558, https://doi.org/10.1039/D1RA08395C], specifically featured in  Fig. 1, Fig. 2 I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
