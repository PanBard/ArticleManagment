Dear P.J.M Carrott,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Carrott, P.; Nabais, J.; Ribeiro Carrott, M.; Pajares, J. Preparation of activated carbon fibres from acrylic textile fibres, Carbon, 39, 2001, 1543, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0008-6223(00)00271-2], specifically featured in Fig. 5., Fig. 6., Fig. 7., Fig. 8., I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
