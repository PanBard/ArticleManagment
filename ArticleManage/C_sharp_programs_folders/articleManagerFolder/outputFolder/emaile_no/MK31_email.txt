Dear Wei Li,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Li, W.; Yang, K.; Peng, J.; Zhang, L.; Guo, S.; Xia, H. Effects of carbonization temperatures on characteristics of porosity in coconut shell chars and activated carbons derived from carbonized coconut shell chars, Industrial Crops and Products, 28, 2008, 190, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2008.02.012], specifically featured in  Fig. 5, Fig. 7 I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
