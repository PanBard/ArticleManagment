Dear Guojie Zhang,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Li, Y.; Zhang, G.; Liu, J.; Li, G.; Wang, Y. Optimized preparation of multi-matrix activated carbon for CO2 capture by response surface methodology: The advantages of co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics, Journal of the Energy Institute, 111, 2023, 101415, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joei.2023.101415], specifically featured in  Fig. 7., Fig. 9., Fig. 10., Fig. 8. I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
