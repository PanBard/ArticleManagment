Dear Zhi-an Zhang,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Zhang, Z.; Cui, M.; Lai, Y.; Li, J.; Liu, Y. Preparation and electrochemical characterization of activated carbons by chemical-physical activation, Journal of Central South University of Technology, 16, 2009, 91, https://doi.org/10.1007/s11771-009-0015-5], specifically featured in Fig.1, Fig.3,Fig.2, Fig.4 I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
