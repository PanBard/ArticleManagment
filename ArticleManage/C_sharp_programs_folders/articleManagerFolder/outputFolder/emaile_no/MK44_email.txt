Dear Dengfeng Zhang,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Tao, J.; Huo, P.; Fu, Z.; Zhang, J.; Yang, Z.; Zhang, D. Characterization and phenol adsorption performance of activated carbon prepared from tea residue by NaOH activation, Environmental Technology, 40, 2019, 171, https://doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2017.1384069], specifically featured in  Figure 1. I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
