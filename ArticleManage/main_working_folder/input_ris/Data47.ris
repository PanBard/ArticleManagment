AB  - The present study concerns the physical activation and chemical oxidation of pitch-based activated carbon fibers (ACFs) as ways to improve the adsorption properties. The surface oxides of the ACFs studied were determined by Boehm's titration and the pore structures were studied by the BET method with N2/77Â K adsorption. Also, the adsorption properties of the ACFs were investigated with chromium ion adsorption by different adsorption models. As a result, it was observed that carboxyl groups were largely created after nitric acid treatment on ACFs. The affinity for chromium ions increases with increasing specific surface area, micropore volume, and surface functionalities of ACFs as the activation time increases.
