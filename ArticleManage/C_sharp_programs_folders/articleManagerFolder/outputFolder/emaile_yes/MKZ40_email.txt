Dear Dan D. Edie,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Lee, Y.; Basova, Y.; Edie, D.; Reid, L.; Newcombe, S.; Ryu, S. Preparation and characterization of trilobal activated carbon fibers, Carbon, 41, 2003, 2573, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0008-6223(03)00376-2], specifically featured in Fig. 9., Fig. 10., Fig. 11.,Fig. 12. I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
