Dear Mengqi Wei,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Wei, M.; Zhao, Q. CO2 Adsorption and Desorption by Waste Ion-Exchange Resinâ€“Based Activated Carbon on Fixed Bed, Frontiers in Energy Research, 9, 2021/11/02, , https://doi.org/10.3389/fenrg.2021.772710], specifically featured in  Figure 2., Figure 3. I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
