Dear Imene Bekri-Abbes,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Nouira, A.; Bekri-Abbes, I.; Srasra, E.; Cansado, I.; Mourão, P. Valorisation of plastic waste from the beverage industry through its transformation into adsorbent and solid fuel materials, Comptes Rendus. Chimie, , 2023, , https://doi.org/10.5802/crchim.214], specifically featured in  Figure 2. I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
