Dear D. Cazorla-Amor칩s,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Maci치-Agull칩, J.; Moore, B.; Cazorla-Amor칩s, D.; Linares-Solano, A. Activation of coal tar pitch carbon fibres: Physical activation vs. chemical activation, Carbon '03 Conference, 42, 2004, 1367, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2004.01.013], specifically featured in Fig. 1., Fig. 4.,Fig. 2., Fig. 3., Fig. 5. I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
