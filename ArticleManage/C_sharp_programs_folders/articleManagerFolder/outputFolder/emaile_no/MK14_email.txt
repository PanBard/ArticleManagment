Dear Guangjie Zhao,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Liu, Z.; Huang, Y.; Zhao, G. Preparation and Characterization of Activated Carbon Fibers from Liquefied Wood by ZnCl2 Activation, Bioresources, 11, 2016/05/01, 3178, https://doi.org/10.15376/biores.11.2.3178-3190], specifically featured in  Fig. 1., Fig. 2., Fig. 3. I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
