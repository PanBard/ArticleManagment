Dear Jing-Pei Cao,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Zhao, X.; Huang, S.; Cao, J.; Xi, S.; Wei, X.; Kamamoto, J.; Takarada, T. KOH activation of a HyperCoal to develop activated carbons for electric double-layer capacitors, Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis, 105, 2014, 116, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2013.10.010], specifically featured in  Fig. 2., Fig. 6., Fig. 5. I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
