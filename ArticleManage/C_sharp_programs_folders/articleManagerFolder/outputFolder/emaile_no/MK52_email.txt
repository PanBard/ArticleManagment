Dear Qingbo Yu,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Wei, M.; Yu, Q.; Duan, W.; Zuo, Z.; Hou, L.; Dai, J. CO2 adsorption and desorption performance of waste ion-exchange resin-based activated carbon, Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy, 37, 2018, 703, https://doi.org/10.1002/ep.12743], specifically featured in  Figure 2., Figure 3. I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
