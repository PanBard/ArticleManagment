Dear Rui A. R. Boaventura,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Pintor, A.; Silvestre-Albero, A.; Ferreira, C.; Pereira, J.; Vilar, V.; Botelho, C.; Rodr√≠guez-Reinoso, F.; Boaventura, R. Textural and Surface Characterization of Cork-Based Sorbents for the Removal of Oil from Water, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 52, 2013, 16427, https://doi.org/10.1021/ie402038n], specifically featured in  Figure 2. I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
