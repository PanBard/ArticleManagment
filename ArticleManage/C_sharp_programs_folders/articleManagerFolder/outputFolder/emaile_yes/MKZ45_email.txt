Dear Macias-Garcıa,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Macias-García, A.; Bernalte García, M.; Díaz-Díez, M.; Hernández Jiménez, A. Preparation of active carbons from a commercial holm-oak charcoal: study of micro- and meso-porosity, Wood Science and Technology, 37, 2004, 385, https://doi.org/10.1007/s00226-003-0191-7], specifically featured in Fig. 1., Fig. 2. I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
