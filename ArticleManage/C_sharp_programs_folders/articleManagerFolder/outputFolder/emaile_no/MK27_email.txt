Dear Changwei Hu,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Li, Y.; Zhang, X.; Yang, R.; Li, G.; Hu, C. The role of H3PO4 in the preparation of activated carbon from NaOH-treated rice husk residue, RSC Adv., 5, 2015, 32626, https://doi.org/10.1039/C5RA04634C], specifically featured in  Fig. 4 (a,c,e), Fig. 4 (b,d,f) I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
