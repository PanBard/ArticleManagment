Dear Xiangdong Xing,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Lan, X.; Jiang, X.; Song, Y.; Jing, X.; Xing, X. The effect of activation temperature on structure and properties of blue coke-based activated carbon by CO2 activation, Green Processing and Synthesis, 8, 2019, 837, https://doi.org/doi:10.1515/gps-2019-0054], specifically featured in  Figure 3, Figure 4 I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
