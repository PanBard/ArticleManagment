Dear Kwang S Kim,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Kemp, K.; Baek, S.; Lee, W.; eyyappan, M.; Kim, K. Activated carbon derived from waste coffee grounds for stable methane storage, Nanotechnology, 26, 2015, 385602, https://doi.org/10.1088/0957-4484/26/38/385602], specifically featured in  Figure 5.(a), Figure 6., Figure 7., Figure 8., Figure 5.(c,d) I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
