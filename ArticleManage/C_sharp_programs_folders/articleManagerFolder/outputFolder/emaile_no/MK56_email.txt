Dear Jianjun Lu,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Ge, C.; Lian, D.; Cui, S.; Gao, J.; Lu, J. Highly Selective CO2 Capture on Waste Polyurethane Foam-Based Activated Carbon, Processes, 7, 2019, , https://doi.org/10.3390/pr7090592], specifically featured in  Figure 7. (a), Figure 9., Figure 7. (b) I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
