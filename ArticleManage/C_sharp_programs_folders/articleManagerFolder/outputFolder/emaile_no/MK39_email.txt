Dear J. J. Rodríguez,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Gonzalez-Serrano, E.; Cordero, T.; Rodríguez-Mirasol, J.; Rodríguez, J. Development of Porosity upon Chemical Activation of Kraft Lignin with ZnCl2, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 36, 1997, 4832, https://doi.org/10.1021/ie970261q], specifically featured in  Figure 3., Figure 6., Figure 5., Figure 7., Figure 8. I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
