Dear Zulamita Zapata-Benabithe,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Kuzmin, O.; Tamarkina, J.; Shendrik, T.; Zubkova, V.; Koval, O.; Roman, T. Production of active coal from pyrolyzed wood wastes by alkaline activation of KOH, Ukrainian Food Journal, 6, 2017/09/01, 443, https://doi.org/10.24263/2304-974X-2017-6-3-5], specifically featured in  Fig. 2 (a), Fig. 2 (b) I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
