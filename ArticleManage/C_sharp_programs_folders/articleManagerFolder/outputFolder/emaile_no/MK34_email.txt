Dear Jinhui Peng,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Yang, K.; Peng, J.; Xia, H.; Zhang, L.; Srinivasakannan, C.; Guo, S. Textural characteristics of activated carbon by single step CO2 activation from coconut shells, Journal of the Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers, 41, 2010, 367, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtice.2009.09.004], specifically featured in  Fig. 4., Fig. 6., Fig. 8., Fig. 9. I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
