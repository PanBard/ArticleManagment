AB  - In this study, the effects of activation parameters in the steam activation of polyacrylonitrile-based carbon fibers on pore formation properties were investigated. The activation temperature was used as a primary parameter, and the activation time was adjusted for each condition to obtain similar levels of activation yields. Based on the activation yield of activated carbon fibers (ACFs), the activation energy was calculated as 142.2kJ/mole. As a result of BET analysis, it was confirmed that the specific surface area and pore volume of ACFs were improved as the activation temperature was increased. The sample treated at 850ÌŠ during 45min showed a high specific surface area (1041.9m2/g) and a pore volume (0.49cm3/g). This developed pore structures improved the gas adsorption properties of ACFs.
