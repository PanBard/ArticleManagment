Dear Ziqiang Lei,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Zhang, Z.; Luo, X.; Liu, Y.; Zhou, P.; Ma, G.; Lei, Z.; , L. A low cost and highly efficient adsorbent (activated carbon) prepared from waste potato residue, Journal of the Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers, 49, 2015, 206, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtice.2014.11.024], specifically featured in  Fig. 2.(a), Fig. 3.(a), Fig. 4.(a), Fig. 2.(b,c), Fig. 3.(b,c), Fig. 4.(b,c) I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
