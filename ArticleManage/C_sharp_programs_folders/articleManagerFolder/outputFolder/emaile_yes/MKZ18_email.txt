Dear A.P Carvalho,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Carvalho, A.; Gomes, M.; Mestre, A.; Pires, J.; Brotas de Carvalho, M. Activated carbons from cork waste by chemical activation with K2CO3: Application to adsorption of natural gas components, Carbon, 42, 2004, 672, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2003.12.075], specifically featured in Fig. 1., Fig. 2. I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
