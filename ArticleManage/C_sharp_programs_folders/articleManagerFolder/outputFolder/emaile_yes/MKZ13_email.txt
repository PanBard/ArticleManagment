Dear F. Rodrı́guez-Reinoso,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Rodrı́guez-Reinoso, F.; Pastor, A.; Marsh, H.; Martı́nez, M. Preparation of activated carbon cloths from viscous rayon. Part II: physical activation processes, Carbon, 38, 2000, 379, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0008-6223(99)00118-9], specifically featured in Fig. 9. I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
