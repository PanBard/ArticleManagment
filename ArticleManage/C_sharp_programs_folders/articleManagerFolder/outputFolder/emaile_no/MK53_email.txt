Dear Habibollah Younesi,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Ekhlasi, L.; Younesi, H.; Rashidi, A.; Bahramifar, N. Populus wood biomass-derived graphene for high CO2 capture at atmospheric pressure and estimated cost of production, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 113, 2018, 97, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psep.2017.09.017], specifically featured in  Fig. 2, Fig. 6 I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
