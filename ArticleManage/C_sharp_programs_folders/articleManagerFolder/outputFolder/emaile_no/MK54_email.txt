Dear Carlos R. Rambo,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Cruz, O.; Gómez, I.; Rodríguez-Reinoso, F.; Silvestre-Albero, J.; Rambo, C.; Martínez-Escandell, M. Activated carbons with high micropore volume obtained from polyurethane foams for enhanced CO2 adsorption, Chemical Engineering Science, 273, 2023, 118671, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2023.118671], specifically featured in  Figure 4., Figure 5. I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
