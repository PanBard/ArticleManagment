Dear Soo-Jin Park,
I am writing to kindly request access to the data presented in your article: [Park, S.; Jang, Y.; Shim, J.; Ryu, S. Studies on pore structures and surface functional groups of pitch-based activated carbon fibers, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 260, 2003, 259, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0021-9797(02)00081-4], specifically featured in Fig. 1., Fig. 3.,Fig. 2. I am particularly interested in obtaining the adsorption isotherms. I am seeking your permission to use this data for testing a new tool for analysing the porous structure of carbonous adsorbents. The results of these tests will be used for publication in international scientific journals.
I would like to assure you that I will diligently cite your mentioned article and include appropriate acknowledgments for granting access to the data. Your kind consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I kindly ask for the provision of the adsorption isotherms in numerical format, preferably in a text file (txt) or spreadsheet (xls), which will facilitate effective analysis.
I am thankful in advance for your understanding and support. I look forward to a positive response to my request.
Sincerely,
